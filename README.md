Weather App

In this app, you will be able to search for a specific location and toggle displaying the data in Fahrenheit or Celsius.

The look of the page will change based on the data (images that describe the weather.) Feel free to use promises or async/await in your code, though you should try to become comfortable with both.

1.Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
2. Write functions that hit the API - Functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. 
3. Write functions that process the JSON data youâ€™re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
4. Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info.
5. Display the information on your webpage!
6. Include a toggle switch for celsius to fahrenheit.
7. Change background image based on current weather
8. Add any styling you like!
